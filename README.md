# Post-it-app
This project was created for my first semester, sorry if code looks very rudimentary
The project consists in a reminder app. Some sort of digital to-do list. There's two implementations of the project, the first one is written completely for terminals. You access an excel document which acts as the database for both versions of the app.
The TKINTER one is my favorite one, because it shows you in a very dynamic manner your homeworks through an easy to use menu with buttons such as add homework, remove homework, load, etc.
